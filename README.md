This Android app has been implemented using MVVM architecture. The following technologies were used:
- Hilt for DI
- Retrofit + RxJava3
- Pagination support using __androidx.paging__ library 
- Glide for image loading
- Mockito for Unit tests

Furthermore the app has been tested with Don't keep activities and it also supports orientation change. A few unit tests were written. Release build has been tested as well.
